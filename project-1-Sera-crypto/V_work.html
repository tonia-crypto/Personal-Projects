    <p>The Lebanese Red Cross performs a variety of duties as part of its mission to assist people in need and improve the quality of life in Lebanon. As a volunteer I served as an emergency responder, providing immediate assistance to people affected by natural disasters, accidents, and other emergencies.
        Also, I offered medical services like first aid, ambulance services, and blood transfusions to those in need.
        I was trained to aid communities affected by disasters.
        Part of our mission was to also conduct health education campaigns and provide information on healthy lifestyles.
        In addition, we offered community support by assisting to vulnerable communities, including refugees and people with disabilities.
        Our mission was far beyond helping, it was giving unconditionally and helping the people of our country, Lebanon.
        Attached below are pictures of me serving in this organization.

            Les Scouts du Liban is a Scouting organization in Lebanon, which provides educational and recreational activities for young people. The organization aims to develop character, encourage personal growth, and foster leadership skills in its members. I was the leader of the Cub scoutsâ€™ group. This is the youngest age for the attendees and we focus a lot on "doing our best" as they are still young and cannot handle as much responsibilities as an adult. Cub scouts learn from observing the pathfinders and aspire to be like them. The activities we do typically include camping, hiking, community service, prayers, discipline games, and personal development workshops. We also participate in national events including Cub scout events or Pioneer events. Scout life teaches discipline as well as surviving habits in time of need. A scout is known to be happy and always rejoice. Paden-Powell, our founder, has established these rules to help us grow strong in communities we belong to. Attached below are pictures of me serving in this organization.
