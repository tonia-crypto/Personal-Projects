    About Me: <br>
    I was born and raised in Lebanon and I had the opportunity to go to a private school where I learned Arabic, English and French. <br>
    I always wanted to make my parents proud, even as a child. Therefore, I excelled in school as a honorary student and made the Dean's list every semester. <br>
    I have a passion in music and arts. I love playing the piano and reading books. I started learning how to play the piano at the age of 4, I also read hundreds of books during my youth years.<br> Additionally, I learned how to swim at a very young age all thanks to my father who was a swim coach.<br>
    I moved to the states at the age of 19 to chase my dreams.<br>
    I am a computer engineer student working on bettering my skills so that I may be prepared for the future.<br>
    I aspire to be a great engineer, some female immigrates can relate to my story given the difficulties of moving countries and starting over. Some may strive to be as good, if not better. <br>I also aspire in the years to come to be a good wife and a mother of many children.
